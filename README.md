# [Cozy](https://cozy.io) v2 Docs

This is the source code of the dccumentation for the old, now deprecated, Node based version of the Cozy server.
The new documentation is available here: https://github.com/cozy/cozy-docs-v3

## Contribution

Any contribution about the documentation is welcome: typos, new way to install,
additional information, etc.

## Hack

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-docs.git

Now you can switch into the created directory and make some changes. If you want to build the documentation, you need to install [docpad](https://docpad.org) and its plugin for jade first. You can do so by:

    npm install -g docpad
    docpad install jade

After that, execute the following commands in the project directory:

    docpad run

You can see the documentation being served on: http://localhost:9778/en/. Do not be irritated if you see only a plain text page welcoming you, append the appropriate path for the page you would like to see, in example: http://localhost:9778/en/hack/getting-started/
