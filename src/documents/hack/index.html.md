## Hacking Cozy

### What do we mean by hacking Cozy? 

You might think that we talk about modifying
directly the code of the platform or 
[contributing in any way to the project](/contribute.html). 
This way is really fine but it's not the most efficient to give your
contribution to the Cozy community. So, the easier way we propose for you to
hack your Cozy is to build a new application. You can work on it without
disturbing other developers and once your app is done it is very
easy to share it with other Cozy users (we can help you to promote it).

### A personal PaaS

Before going further, let's be clear: **writing an app for Cozy is like
writing a classical web app**.  Because Cozy is a Platform As A Service, namely
an execution environment for applications, it allows you to deploy any kind of
web app. The main constraint is to write it with NodeJS until we support other
development environment such as Ruby and Python.

### Painless web development

Moreover Cozy comes with the painless web development principles: 

* application templates: no configuration headache
* easy deployment: deploy your app to your cozy with one command line
* access user data: no need to rebuild modules again and again, you can reuse
  existing data from existing ones (contacts, calendar...)
* access to user data: you can build new services that was not possible before
  Cozy

As you can see web development with Cozy is more straightforward, so you can
focus on your application features only. Now that you have enough good reasons
to start with Cozy, let's hack!

### Write your first web app for Cozy

To begin we'll introduce you to the standard NodeJS
tools. This way your application will work in any environment. Then 
we'll introduce you to our favorite tools to make your Cozy development
experience more delightful and efficient: get ready for **painless
web development** with Cozy!
