# Hacking Cozy

### What do we mean by hacking Cozy? 

You might think that we talk about modifying
directly the code of the platform or 
[contributing in any way to the project](/contribute). 
This way is really fine but it's not the most efficient to give your
contribution to the Cozy community. So, the easier way we propose for you to
hack your Cozy is to build a new application. You can work on it without
disturbing other developers and once your app is done it is very
easy to share it with other Cozy users (we can help you to promote it).

### A personal PaaS

Before going further, let's be clear: **writing an app for Cozy is like
writing a classical web app**.  Because Cozy is a Platform As A Service, namely
an execution environment for applications, it allows you to deploy any kind of
web app. The main constraint is to write it with NodeJS until we support other
development environment such as Ruby and Python.

### Painless web development

Moreover Cozy comes with the painless web development principles: 

* application templates: no configuration headache
* easy deployment: deploy your app to your cozy with one command line
* access user data: no need to rebuild modules again and again, you can reuse
  existing data from existing ones (contacts, calendar...)

As you can see web development with Cozy is more straightforward, so you can
focus on your application features only. Now that you have enough good reasons
to start with Cozy, [let's hack](/hack/getting-started.html)!
