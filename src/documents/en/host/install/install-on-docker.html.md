# Install Cozy on Docker

---

** <img src="/assets/images/warning.png" alt="warning" class="warn">This document with instructions explains how to install the old Cozy prototype, but is now out of date. Instructions on how to install the new Cozy will be available soon. Stay tuned!**

**The Docker support for Cozy is still experimental, please use the container with caution.**

*You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) v1.0.1 or newer to run this image*

---

You can try Cozy very easily by pulling the official automatically built image
from Docker Hub:

```
sudo docker pull cozy/full
```

If you want to run it in a production environment, it is recommended to build
the image yourself:

```
sudo docker build -t cozy/full github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-docker
```

Then you can run the image:

```
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 cozy/full
```

You can indicate different ports if your port 80 and 443 are already in use.
For example:
```
sudo docker run -d -p 6500:443 cozy/full
```

Then your Cozy should be accessible on https://localhost:443 (or
https://localhost:6500 for the second example)
