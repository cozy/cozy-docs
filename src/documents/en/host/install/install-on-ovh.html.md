**Start quickly using Cozy with OVH pre-configured virtual private servers.**

**It's easy. Everything can be done from the browser.**

Product page: https://www.ovh.com/us/vps/

more stable).

## 2. Size your VPS.

Chose among the different sizes of disk space and pricing. Every VPS proposes
2GB of RAM which is enough for Cozy.

## 5. Wait for the installation email and start using your Cozy.

You will receive an email from OVH confirming you that your VPS was shipped.

Connection credentials are given in the email. OVH will automatically create a
user on your Cozy. So, once you connect with the credentials given in the
email, go directly to the settings section to update your parameters and change
your password.

And now enjoy your personal server!
