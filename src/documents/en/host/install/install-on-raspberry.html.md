# Install Cozy on a Raspberry Pi

---

** <img src="/assets/images/warning.png" alt="warning" class="warn">This document with instructions explains how to install the old Cozy prototype, but is now out of date. Instructions on how to install the new Cozy will be available soon. Stay tuned!**

**You will need the latest [Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry Pi 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) to be able to run Cozy properly.**

**A class10 high-speed SD card is also highly recommended.**


In order to run Cozy on your Raspberry Pi, you need to:

* Download our [image](https://files.cozycloud.cc/raspberrypi/cozy-raspberrypi_latest.img.xz) and decompress it (`xz -d cozy-raspberrypi_4.1.0.img.xz` on Linux, use your favorite software on Windows and MacOs).
* Download the image's signatures [here](https://files.cozycloud.cc/raspberrypi/cozy-raspberrypi_latest.img.xz.sha512.asc) and [here](https://files.cozycloud.cc/raspberrypi/cozy-raspberrypi_latest.img.xz.sha512).
* Check the integrity of the image:

```
gpgv2 -v cozy-raspberrypi_4.1.0.img.xz.sha512.asc
sha512sum -c cozy-raspberrypi_4.1.0.img.xz.sha512
```

The image is based on [Raspbian Jessie lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

**WARNING:** The following operations will erase all data previously stored on the card.

Then follow the official Raspberry Pi guide on [Installing operating system images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).

Now, insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi, and boot it.

You can reach your Pi on `https://cozy.local/`.

In order to log into the board via SSH, you can use the default Raspbian credentials
```pi``` and ```raspberry```:

```bash
$ ssh pi@cozy.local # or ssh pi@<ip-of-your-raspberrypi>

```

In order to expand the partition, follow those steps:

* log into the board via SSH
* run this command: `/usr/bin/raspi-config --expand-rootfs`


# Troubleshooting

## Host cozy.local doesn't work

Alternatively, you can determine your Pi's IP address and access it directly:

If you are not able to retrieve it from the console, you can use
`nmap` on your local workstation:

```
nmap -T4 -sP 192.168.x.0/24  # Or your sub network
```

## Corrupted filesystem

If after a brutal system halt, the server refuse to boot again, and you get a “vfs unable to mount root fs on unknown-block” message when plugging a screen, the filesystem is probably corrupted. You can try to fix this by mounting the SD card on another server and perform a file system check. Run `lsblk` to identify the device, then `e2fsck` to try to fix the filesystem.
