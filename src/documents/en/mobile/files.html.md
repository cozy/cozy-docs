Once installed, run it and it will ask you for a
few information:

* The domain where your Cozy is located
* The password of your Cozy (not stored, just used to register the device the
  first time)
* The name used by your device to register to your Cozy
* A few settings about your photos backup

Once done, you have to confirm and wait for the first time synchronization to
finish.

## Browse files from your phone

Now that all your file tree is synced, you can browse your files from your
mobile. If you want to display a file, you can tap on it. It will download it
to the phone/tablet.  That way it will be kept on your mobile even if you lose
the connection.

Here are a few use cases covered by Cozy Mobile:

* Carrying your digital tickets for an event without printing them.
* Reading digital books in the transportation.
* Listening your music from your cloud on speakers through Bluetooh.
* Watching TV shows from your cloud while waiting in the line.

A search field is available too, it's useful to find quickly an important file.

## Backup your photos, make albums and share them

By default the Cozy Mobile will save every pictures it finds on your Mobile to
your Cozy. On your remote Cozy, the pictures will be located in a folder that
has the same name as the device.

NB: If you want to save bandwidth, you can disable this feature via the
configuration screen.

Once done, by installing through the Photos application,
you can build new album from the files stored in your Cozy (so from your
mobile pictures).

Then, you can share the album via a simple click on the share button and
selecting your contacts with who you want to share the album.

## Note about self-signed certificates
About Self hosted instances, you probably have a self-signed certificate.
Cozy Mobile won't recognize it until you validate it on your mobile. See
[there](http://davdroid.bitfire.at/faq/entry/importing-a-certificate)
for instruction on how to do it.
