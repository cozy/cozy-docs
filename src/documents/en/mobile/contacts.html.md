You are now ready to synchronize your devices!

Check the section relevant to your device's system to continue.

## Android

#### Install
There are multiple applications that can achieve what we want, but we advise you to use [DavDroid](http://davdroid.bitfire.at/) because it's open-source, though it's a paid app on the PlayStore.

Note: you can download it and install for free from the [F-droid store](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=at.bitfire.davdroid).

#### Configure
Once it's installed, open the application and click on the button to create a new account (see the blue circle on the picture below).
