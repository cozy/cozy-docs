# Frequently Asked Questions

There are several ways to contact our friendly Support team:

 - ask questions on the forum [forum.cozy.io](https://forum.cozy.io/) where the community is always ready to help;
 - if you encouter issues on your server, describe them in the form inside the Help page (available at the bottom of the Home app). This form will send us some informations so we can debug the problem;
 - and of course, you can send us emails at the following address: support@cozycloud.cc.


## Where is your datacenter located?

Our infrastructure is located in Roubaix, France.


## Is my data safe?

Cozy has put in place several features in order to protect the user’s data. For instance, all the passwords you store inside Cozy are encrypted using your main password, so even in case of data breach, your bank or email account credentials will stay safe.
We also perform daily backups of your data, so we can restore them if needed.


## How much data can I store on my server

We provide 40GB of storage with each instance (well, technically 60GB are available, but we recommend for now not to use more than 40GB)

## What can i do if I forget/loose my password ?

For security and confidentiality reasons, we never have access to your decrypted password, and as a result, your datas of your different apps will be lost. But happely enough, not your cozy ! The only solution is to create a new password by retyping your new password in the "password recovery email", that you can activate in the login page of your cozy. You will then have to reinitialize all your apps.
