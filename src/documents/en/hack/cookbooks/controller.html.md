# The Controller API

The Controller API allows applications management

## Generic notes

All the responses' bodies are encoded in JSON and all the data you send along request should be encoded in JSON.

You will find HTTP status code for the response, here is what they mean:

* 200: success
* 400: bad request
* 401: not authenticated
* 500: internal server error


Application should be authenticated to request controller.

Authentication is based on a token shared by all the Cozy stack.
This token should be sent in 'x-auth-token' request header. This token is stored in **/etc/cozy/stack.token** by default but this is configurable. Accessing it requires `sudo` privileges.

## Application manifest

Application are declared in a manifest.

Manifest example :

```json
manifest =
    user: "cozy",      # Required, user which start the application
    name: "note",
    domain: "localhost",
    repository:
        type: "git",
        url: "https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-notes.git",
    scripts:
        start: "server.js"
```


## New application API

## Configuration

Configuration are stored in file **/etc/cozy/controller.json**.
Every configurations are optional.

Configuration file is avaible only for new controller.

### Common configuration

* **npm_registry**:
  * Specify a npm registry.
  * Use common npm registry by default.
* **npm_strict_ssl**:
  * Specify if you want use strict ssl option with npm.
  * By default : false.

<!--
* **dir_log**:
  * Directory where application logs are stored
  * By default: '/var/log/cozy'.
* **dir_source**:
  * Directory where application code source are stored
  * By default: '/usr/local/cozy/apps'.
-->

### Environement configuration

* env :
    * global
    * data_system
    * home
    * proxy


### File configuration example
```json
{
  "npm_registry": https://my-registry.com,
  "npm_strict_ssl": true,
  "env":
    {
      "global": {"STACK": "cozy"},
      "data_system": {"DB": "mydatabase"},
      "home": {"PORT": 9103},
      "proxy": {"PORT": 9104}
    }
}
```

## Files used

Controller stores several files in **/etc/cozy**, **/usr/local/cozy** and **/usr/local/var/log/cozy**.

In **/etc/cozy**, controller stores configurations:
  * **controller.json**: Contains controller configurations (see [Configuration section](controller.html#configuration))
  * **stack.token**: Contains token shared by cozy stack (Controller, Data system, Home and Proxy). This token is generated at each controller starting.
  * **.controller.json-backup**: Hidden file, used for configuration changes.

In **/usr/local/cozy**, controller stores information about applications:
  * **apps**: Contains all application source code.
  * **apps/stack.json**: Contains information about stack cozy (git repository, branch, start script, ...).

In **/usr/local/var/log/cozy**, controller stores all application logs:
  * **app.log**: Logs for application app.

## Autostart

When controller is started, it starts all applications that were running before it stops.

Autostart has several steps :

  * Check if couchdb server is started
    * Controller try 5 times (with 5 seconds between two tests)
    * If couchDB server doesn't respond, controller is stopped
  * Check if stack applications are installed
    * If Data System is not installed, controller starts without starts other applications
  * Start Data System application
    * If Data System cannot start, controller is stopped
  * Retrieve all application stored in database
    * Start all application which have 'installed' as state
  * Start Home application
  * Start Proxy application
