# Uninstall your Cozy
Warning: this will delete all your data.

## Virtual machines and containers

If you installed Cozy in a virtual machine or in a container, you just have
to remove that virtual machine or container.


## Easy way

The easiest way to uninstall Cozy is to use the Fabric installation file used for the installation. But in this case, you should not call the installation task but the uninstall task:

```bash
fab -H user@ip uninstall_all
```

## Manual uninstall

If you want to uninstall your Cozy without Fabric, you can run the following
commands directly on your server.

```bash
supervisorctl stop cozy-controller
supervisorctl stop cozy-indexer
supervisorctl stop couchdb
rm -rf /usr/local/var/cozy-indexer
rm -f /etc/supervisor/conf.d/cozy-controller.conf
rm -f /etc/supervisor/conf.d/cozy-indexer.conf
rm -rf /usr/local/cozy
rm -rf /etc/cozy
apt-get purge supervisord
```
